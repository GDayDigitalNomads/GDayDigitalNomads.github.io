It is generally accepted that English today is arguably the most important language for people to learn.

In our travels we have met many people from many walks of life trying to make money whilst traveling, and one of the most sort after jobs for such travelers has been that of an **English Teacher or Tutor**. Such jobs generally requires little or no formal teaching skills other than English as a spoken language, and often come with a list of additional benefits such as housing, living allowances, paid holidays and travel exxpences. Not to mention its often tax-free. Check out our **[Top 12 Places to Teach English in The World](/blog/travel/digital-nomads/english/tutoring/top-12-english-teaching-locations-in-the-world.html)** article for more information.

In our research we found several interesting facts:

**1)**&nbsp;These opportunities are in abundance, the skills offered by Native English Speakers are in high demand. All through Africa, Asia, Middle-East and South-Central America, and many countries in Europe are soaking up individuals with the English Language as a skillset at extraordinary rates.

**2)**&nbsp;There is a great shortage of English Teachers filling these roles - Kindergarden to Adults, permanent or casual.

**3)**&nbsp;Expats filling these roles are not always around for long periods of time so there is a high employee turnover rate.

**4)**&nbsp;Whether it be a reputable international schools, government funded schools or specialist education groups the quality of instruction for students are not equal. Some have well developed curriculum, some not so much.

**5)**&nbsp;Required qualifications range from University trained to traveling Native English Expats. 

But the bottom line is the quality of delivery and results for students studying English as a Second Language predominately depends on the curriculum and structure that has been set in place by the organisation they are affiliated with, and despite the damand for such roles, many non-native speakers around the world have very limited access to well-structured lessons taught by native English teachers.

This is our motivation for creating [**Berry Berry** : *An Online Tutoring Platform*](#).

Berry Berry was designed to bridge a gap - Children and Adults alike from lower socio-economic areas all the way to highly developed communities could now have access to the same structured and proven resources. All that is required is an internet connection.

If you are still interested in traveling to these countries to become resident teacher, which we highly recommend, then visit this article on [Top 12 Places to Teach English in The World](/blog/travel/digital-nomads/english/tutoring/top-12-english-teaching-locations-in-the-world.html).
