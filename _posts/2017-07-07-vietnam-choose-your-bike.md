Everything started with my partners dream a few years ago to motorbike through Vietnam. Yes, this is the dream of many backpackers, even though the transportation in Vietnam is good and cheap, biking adds that thrill and feeling of freedom and the chance to discover those out-of-the-way places standard transport can't get to.
After two weeks of research we finally bought our bike in Ho Chi Minh city.
Why two weeks? First, I had never biked before - I wasn’t even sure if i could drive by myself; and second, I'm very meticulous when it comes to buying something that so important to our safety, so i researched all the possibilities...even took some driving lessons. For two weeks I read as much as I could about the process, the scams and how to choose a safe bike.

<h3>Choosing your bike</h3>

<p>There are three different types of bikes - Automatic, Semi-Automatic or Manual transmissions.</p>

<p>With an Automatic transmission, you don’t have to worry about gears. The bike will do it all for you. It is really useful in busy cities when you have to stop often but i would not recommend it for long distance and mountain riding. You will not have enough power or control on the steep slopes of Vietnamese Mountains.</p> 

<p>To cross the country, the best choice for us was a manual. I tried both, semi-auto and manual - Manuals aren't that difficult, although it may take you few days to get confident. Semi-Automatic are basically the same as a manual but without the need for a clutch to change gears. But to be honest whatever you choose, riding any bike in Vietnam comes with alot of risk! (check <a href="">my what could happen on the road list</a>)</p>

<h4>The Truth about Bike Brands in Vietnam</h4>

As a newbie, I read many articles about which bike is the most reliable, the price I should expected, and best roads to drive…. the information was ambiguous at best. My first impression about bikes in Vietnam was every bike a disaster waiting to happen, all roads are really bad, and your insurance will not cover you… But at the same time, many backpackers dream of experiencing Vietnam in this adventurous way. It gave us freedom to visit many remote areas, and see this gorgeeous country in a wonderful way. It has been by far been our most enjoyable experience traveling through South-East Asia so far.

To be honest, if my partner wasn’t there, I wouldn't have chosen to bike through Vietnam by myself. It is truly not a easy trip for beginner riders, especially in the north. At the same time, I have no regret doing it at all, it was an amazing way to explore the country and discover many homestays you cannot reach by bus.

MY HONEST ADVICE: Accidents happen, and can be disastrous. Local drivers can be atrocious. Unexpected things happen. So... be aware, take your time, be restful and make sure your bike is 100%.

<h4>History of the Honda Win</h4>
Honda stopped making real wins in 2000. Soon after the Chinese created a replica. It is really hard to come across a real Honda win these days, most people believe that their bike is a real honda when in fact they are copies. The Vietnamese created their own replica in 2006, a more reliable version called a <em>Sufat</em>. <em>Detech</em> is the most recent Vietnamese brand that build replica win models, at the moment they are producing the most reliable and better performing bike.

<h4>Rebuilt bikes</h4>
Basically, the bikes you'll be looking at do many trips north to south, south to north, and get passed between travelers times and time again, being rebuild piece by piece by different mechanics along the journey.

Vietnamese made Honda Wins are the most popular. They are cool and look amazing. But the truth is real Honda Win aren't actually in production any more (except for the copies :-) )!  They are good because almost all mechanics have spare parts and can easily service and fix cheaply so if you do encounter a problem on your trip (90% likely) then its easy to find a good mechanic in most villages.

IMPORTANT! Be aware of bad Chinese copy. They'll be cheaper, it'll cost you more in safety or mechanic costs in the end. You can read this articles for  a better understanding about all the differences.

<h4>Expected Price</h4>
Around $200US to $600US depending on how new the bike is.
It is cheaper in Hanoi than Ho Chi Minh.
Our bike costs us $300 and we spent around $70 for the mechanics over the trip. 

<h3>Where to buy:</h3>

<h4>From a shop</h4>

The most trustful shop  found were <a href="http://www.stylemotorbikes.com/">style motorbikes</a>, who gave me a free driving lesson and good advices, and <a href="https://www.tigitmotorbikes.com/">tigitmotorbikes</a> from other backpackers. 

Be Careful with the bike rebuild by a shop: From our experience, many are scam where they can try to sell a rebuild bike, chinese copy instead of a real honda win - beware, the black spraypainted bike! You don't know what it is. Not saying it is bad quality, just be sure to check.  

<h4>From a traveler</h4>

It may or may not be reliable, really depends how well the backpacker maintained it, or how old some of the more crucial parts are....i.e Motors and Transmission Boxes are expensive to replace, tyres and brakes are cheap.

-Hostels 
    -Many hostels also have flyers about travelers leaving and wanting to pass their bike on.</p>

<strong>Other options if you are not sure to buy one</strong>
-Rental, if you're travel less than a month, check with <a href="http://www.stylemotorbikes.com/">style motorbikes</a>, they have shops in HCM and Hanoi, so you can do the trip from one city and let your bike to the other. 
-Hire a driver, if you are less confident to ride. It is good way to do it safely. 
Check <a href="http://www.easy-riders.net/">Easy-rider</a>, they do a lot of trip short or long, many around Hoi An and Da Lat. 

<h4>Before you say YES, check the mechanics or find one you can trust</h4>
<p>If you are new, try to find a friend who knows a little bit about bikes, or find a mechanic that can check it over for you. Test drive it thoroughly.

-Check the Brakes;
-Check the Transmission;
-Check the Suspension;
-Check the throttle and the motor;
-Check the Electricals - we missed this one, and spent alot getting new lights and batteries for bad wiring.

We found most mechanics to actually be very honest and valuable. Not so much with the bike shop owners.
 
Our original plan was to buy a bike each, but we met several couples who did the trip in tandem. For this reason, and also at the insistance of my partner who saw me drive after several driving lessons and decided emphatically that I would not come back alive... "<i>Audrey, you have many talents, driving safely is just not one of them</i>" Jordan Rancie

Best decision ever, as it was more fun witht hte two of us, i could take pictures, be an onboard GPS Navigator (with a French accent), and ultimately keep away the boredome after a 200km ride.

We bought a rebuild bike ( Detech Espero Win 110)  from a backpacker couple after their trip from Laos to South vietnam. Rebuilt engine. Good transmission. Custom  racks mounted to the side we carried 2 backpacks, 1 full-sized guitar, 1 ukulele and computer bag and ourselves (around 190kg)! with no major issues, just a few things to change due to wear and tear.

One other point of advice. Driving in the North is far more tretcherous, mountains a steeper, its wetter, and roads can be attroucous. So leave as much luggage as you can in Hanoi if you attempt this!

<strong>Final Advice</strong>

Take your time when buying a bike; don’t be pushed into buying something you are not 100% sure about, there are a lot of offers, no worries if the first bike is not for you.
