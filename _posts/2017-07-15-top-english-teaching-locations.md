#### Land of Lakes & Volcanoes
{: class="theme-color"}

If you seek an authentic Latin American experience in a fast-growing teaching market that remains virtually undiscovered, Nicaragua provides a perfect opportunity. In addition, according to a 2014 Gallup Survey Nicaragua is regarded as the safest country in the region.

Nicaragua may be the best kept secret in Latin America. Like Costa Rica, Nicaragua is a small country in the heart of Latin America that offers alluring beaches, lush topography and a fast-growing job market for teaching English abroad. However, unlike Costa Rica and Panama, Nicaragua remains largely undiscovered by tourists, retirees and cruise ship operators. Those who want to teach English in Nicaragua will typically find jobs in larger cities such as Managua (the capital), Grenada and Leon, two beautiful 500-year-old cities known for their vibrant street life and magnificent colonial architecture. In addition, the cost of living in Nicaragua is super low.  Most foreign English teachers rarely pay more than the equivalents of $100-$150 a month in rent and basic necessities like food and transportation often cost five to ten times less than what you might be used to paying in the U.S., Canada or Europe.

Typically, to get hired to teach English in Nicaragua, you should plan on going there to interview in person, and jobs open throughout the year. Private tutoring is also a great way to earn extra income.

### Colombia
{: class="m-bot-1 theme-color"}
#### Fastest growing economies in Latin America
{: class="theme-color"}

Columbia represents one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America as well as one of top job markets for teaching English. Cities like Bogota and Medillin have become dynamic centers of commerce and culture, renowned for their colorful markets and fast-paced nightlife. In addition, Colombia offers magnificent beaches, lush rain forests, and rich history and culture.

English teachers will find opportunities in private language schools and the Ministry of Education has also begun to recruit foreign instructors as well. A growing number of schools interview English teachers in advance and it is also possible to find many opportunities locally as well.

### Czech Republic
{: class="m-bot-1 theme-color"}
#### Land of Castles & Beer
{: class="theme-color"}

If you seek to live in a classic European setting complete with medieval castles, cobblestone streets, picturesque villages and great bars and cafes, then teaching English in the Czech Republic will be your kind of place for teaching English abroad. As an up-and-coming economy in the heart of Europe, Czech Republic is also one of the top job markets for teaching English in Europe even though it is not a large nation. 
 
Czech Republic is a nation where it is easier to get a legal work permit to teach English than it is in some other European nations, and the cost of living is lower than in some Western European nations like France and Germany. In addition, its prime location in the heart of Europe makes it very convenient for travel to countries like Poland, Hungary, Germany and Austria.

### Poland
{: class="m-bot-1 theme-color"}
#### A Rising Economic Star from Old Europe
{: class="theme-color"}

Since since the end of the Cold War a generation ago, Poland has emerged as an economic star among the old Eastern Bloc nations. With a dynamic economy dependent on competition in a global economy, Poland is experiencing a major boom in demand for English teachers. But it's not just the job market that Poland has to offer. Major cities like Krakow, Gdansk & Warsaw offer English teachers a wealth of fantastic architecture, history & culture.

Qualified citizens can interview and line up a job in advance from their home countries, while EU citizens can often line up an English teaching job locally in Poland.  Many English teachers share an apartment with co-workers or other English teachers in Poland. 

Some schools in Poland will sponsor a work visa for Americans and other non-European Union citizens (teachers will also need to get a residence permit upon arrival).  While some non-EU citizens may work on a tourist visa "under the table", this is not as common as it is in some other European countries like Spain & Italy.

### Brazil
{: class="p-top-20 m-bot-1 theme-color"}
#### A MUST SEE Country. Seriously.
{: class="m-bot-10 theme-color"}

As it did during the FIFA World Cup of 2014, the sporting world turned its eyes on Brazil in 2016 as Rio De Janeiro hosted the immensely successful 2016 Summer Olympiad.

With a huge population that is increasingly making the nation a major international economic force, Brazil is now in major demand for English language instruction. This has only increased as Brazil has cemented its international profile while hosting such major events as the World Cup in 2014 and the Summer Olympiad of 2016.

### Spain
{: class="m-bot-1 theme-color"}
#### Home of Tapas, Flamenco & Lifestyle 
{: class="theme-color"}

Of all the countries we have visited in Europe, Spain was by far our favourite - wonderful people with a knack for knowing how to enjoy life, delicious cuisines, and a rich history steeped in cultures from many people due to its occupancy of different cultures over the last 2,000 years.

The demand for English teachers in Spain remains among the strongest in Europe. The key for getting a job in Spain is to be on the ground with a TEFL certification and ready to interview during prime hiring seasons: mid-September through mid-October and again in January right after 3 Kings Day, which is January 6.  The biggest job market by far is Madrid, which makes it an ideal spot for beginning your job search.  Barcelona is also a large job market, and you may want to consider a city like Bilbao, which is not as well-known and therefore is less competitive, but still offers an awesome experience. Other opportunities include Valencia, Granada (personal favourite), Malaga and Seville.


### Statistics on English Teachers by Country

#### Asia

The job market for English teachers in East and Southeast Asia is the largest in the world. Most of these nations are highly industrialized and economically strong with large populations, enormous middle classes and an extremely high demand for education. This combination has created the strongest outward recruitment market in the world and hundreds of thousands of jobs paying wages that far exceed the cost of living. The job markets for teaching both adults and young learners (children and adolescents) are both strong as native English speakers are commonly recruited to teach in public schools and many children attend English language school after their public school day finishes. With such high competition for quality teachers, schools charge a considerable amount to their students and provide teachers with such benefits as free airfare, housing allowances, medical insurance, paid vacation and a completion bonus.

Teachers are paid in the local currency and make a comfortable wage working full time.

#### Middle East and North Africa

The Middle East incorporates a broad array of job markets for English teachers. Oil rich nations of the Persian Gulf offer some of the most lucrative ESL teaching positions in the world, but job markets are small and competitive, and many jobs require previous experience and advanced credentials. First-time teachers will find more opportunities in countries like Turkey, Egypt, and Morocco, where salaries and benefits are more modest, but the cost of living is low and the experience of living in one of the world’s most historic and culturally rich societies is second to none. The majority of jobs will be found in private schools and language institutes teaching both adults and children.

### On a final note

As I started saying at the beginning of this post, if you have not traveled much in your life, my suggestions is go. Go now. There are always reasons not to, but they are rarely insurmountable hurdles...nothing enriches the souls like traveling through the world we live in. It's a big place. We have a big family. And there is possibly no better way to do this than through the opportunities of Teaching overseas.
